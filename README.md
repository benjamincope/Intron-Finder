# Intron-Finder
This is an upload of most of the necessary files I made for my university major project. The main program is 'final_intron_finder.py' and the testing program is 'FIP_tester.py'. Some of the files necessary to run the main program and receive a detailed output requires large genome files which I haven't uploaded presently due to the amount of storage they take up. The 'dummy_FASTA.txt' and 'dummy_GFF.txt' files are very small dummy versions of genome files which I have used by 'FIP_tester.py' to test for issues/bugs in 'final_intron_finder.py'. The text file 'introns_final.txt' shows the output after running the program on a large amount of genomes files. A full explanation of my project is contained within 'Report.pdf'. This includes the design details, the process I used, my process of implementing the program over time, test results etc.
